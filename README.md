Practical Unix/Linux Tips and Tricks 

An former co-worker of mine used to, and probably still has that
notebook of hers, where she wrote all kind of notes so that she could
repeat a task if needed. I envied her for her effort and but was too lazy
and silly to copy the habit. I'm kind of incompatible with notebooks.

Much later it occurred to me, that I could replace the notebook with a
github project.
